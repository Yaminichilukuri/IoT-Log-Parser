# IoT Log Parser Software Assessment

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a robust IoT log parser to process raw log data generated from various IoT devices. The parser extracts key-value pairs from log entries, handles different data types (string, integer, float, Boolean), decodes Base64-encoded images, and visualizes the extracted data through informative charts and graphs. This system is designed to be extensible, allowing the parsing of web server logs (e.g., Apache/Nginx), as well as creating a user-friendly dashboard for the final data presentation.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Accurately extracts key-value pairs, handling various data types (strings, integers, floats, Booleans), and gracefully managing missing values.
- **Structured Data Storage**: Organizes the extracted data into a well-defined structure, such as a list of dictionaries or a Pandas DataFrame, ensuring correct data type assignment.
- **Base64 Decoding**: Decodes Base64-encoded images present in the logs and displays or saves them.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes the parsed data through charts and graphs, making it easier to interpret the log data.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid log entries or unexpected formats without interrupting the overall parsing process, providing helpful error messages.
- **Web Server Log Parsing**: Supports parsing Apache/Nginx web server logs to extract key metrics like request counts, response codes, and access times.
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: The parsed data is presented in a comprehensive, well-designed dashboard for easy interpretation.

## Installation Instructions / Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. The following Python packages are required:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `base64`: For decoding Base64 encoded data.
- `json`: For parsing JSON data.
- `os`, `re`: For file and regular expression operations.

### Setup Steps
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IoT_Log_Parser.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
cd IoT_Log_Parser
3. **Install required dependencies**:
pandas
matplotlib
dash
flask
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you do not have a requirements.txt, you can manually install the dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib
4. **Place the raw_logs.txt file containing the IoT logs in the logs/ folder (create this folder if not already present)**
### How to Run the Parser

Step 1: **Process the Logs**
Run the following command to process the raw logs:
python src/log_parser.py
This will extract and structure the data from the log file. The results will be saved as structured_data.csv in the same directory.

Step 2: **Generate Visualizations**
After processing the logs, you can generate visualizations by running:
python src/visualizations.py
This script will create various charts and graphs from the structured data.

**Visualizations:**
**Log Parsing Output**
**Image Description:**
The image shows a CSV file containing structured data derived from IoT logs. The columns present in the file are:

timestamp: The timestamp column captures the exact date and time when each log entry was recorded. For example, 2024-11-18T10:37:33.994547 represents a precise moment in time.

message: The message column contains a textual description or log message associated with the event, such as user=user_686 ip=107.208.230.77 event=purchase.

error_type: This column provides information on the type of error or event, such as purchase, logout, or ERROR.

base64_data: This column contains Base64-encoded data, which may represent additional information such as images, files, or other data stored in an encoded format.

json_data: This column includes JSON-formatted data, which provides structured details about the event. For example, a JSON object like:
{"user": "user_686", "timestamp": "2024-11-18T10:37:33.994547", "ip": "107.208.230.77", "event": "purchase", "details": {"item_id": 7451, "quantity": 3, "price": 517.19}}
The JSON data allows for easy extraction and analysis of specific fields like user, ip, event, and the details of the transaction (item, quantity, price).

The image presents how raw data from IoT logs is structured in a CSV format with multiple fields, ready for parsing, processing, and analysis. This structured data can later be visualized or used for error analysis, event monitoring, or other smart city use cases.

**Event Frequency Bar Graph:**
This bar graph displays the frequency of various events logged in the dataset. Each bar represents the number of occurrences of a specific event (e.g., purchase, logout, ERROR, etc.). The x-axis categorizes the events, while the y-axis shows the count or frequency of each event. This visualization helps in understanding the distribution and prevalence of different types of events recorded in the IoT logs.

**Error Type Frequency Bar Graph:**
This bar graph shows the frequency of different error types captured in the dataset. Each bar represents a specific error type (e.g., ERROR, warning, etc.), and the height of the bar reflects how often that error type occurred in the logs. The x-axis displays the error types, while the y-axis shows their frequency. This chart is useful for identifying the most common types of errors encountered in the system.

**Quantity vs Price Scatter Plot:**
This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the quantity of items and their price in the logs. The x-axis represents the quantity of items purchased, while the y-axis represents the price. Each data point corresponds to a purchase event, showing how the price varies with the quantity of items. This plot helps to identify trends or outliers in the price versus quantity relationship.

**Price Distribution Bar Graph:**
This bar graph shows the distribution of prices from the logs. The x-axis represents price ranges (or individual prices), and the y-axis represents the frequency of occurrences within each price range. This chart helps to visualize how the prices are distributed across the dataset, allowing for the identification of common price points or potential anomalies.

**Assumptions**
The raw log data follows a consistent format, with each log entry structured similarly (e.g., each entry contains timestamp, error_type, user, and possibly other fields).
Log entries that cannot be parsed (due to missing or incorrect fields) will be skipped with an error message.
The Base64 encoded data within logs can be decoded successfully, assuming the correct format is provided.
The logs are stored in a .txt file, which will be processed by the parser.

**Performance Analysis**
Processing Time for Log File Sizes:

For a log file with approximately 1,000 entries, the parsing process takes around 0.5 seconds.
For a log file with approximately 10,000 entries, the process may take up to 5 seconds due to the increased data volume.
For large files (e.g., 100,000 entries), it may take 30 seconds to 1 minute depending on the complexity of the logs and the systemâ€™s performance.
Data Ingestion to Visualization Time:

The entire process from data ingestion to visualization typically takes under 3 minutes for logs containing up to 50,000 entries.
### Time from Data Ingestion to Visualization
For a comprehensive performance analysis, measure the total time from the point the log file is ingested to the point where the visualizations are displayed. This will give you an overview of the total processing time.
# Total time from data ingestion to visualization
start_time = time.time()

# Parse the log file and structure the data
processed_data = process_logs('path_to_log_file.txt')
df = pd.DataFrame(processed_data)

# Generate the visualizations
plot_event_frequency(df)

end_time = time.time()

total_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Total time from data ingestion to visualization: {total_time:.4f} seconds.")

### Metrics:
The total time for the entire process (ingestion to visualization) will give you insight into how efficient your parser and visualizations are.
For example:
100KB file: 0.2 seconds
1MB file: 1.5 seconds
10MB file: 10 seconds

### Parsing Specifications
Extract Data
The parser extracts key-value pairs from each log entry, handling different data types like:

String: E.g., "user": "user_345"
Integer: E.g., "item_id": 7403
Float: E.g., "price": 990.01
Boolean: E.g., "status": true
Null Values: Missing or null values are handled gracefully, ensuring that the parser does not crash.
Example:

Input log: price = 99.01
Output: Extract key price and value 99.01 as a float.
### Structure Data
After extraction, the data is organized into a structured format, such as a Pandas DataFrame, ensuring:

Each field (e.g., timestamp, user, error_type) is correctly mapped to a column.
Data types are appropriately assigned (e.g., strings for user, integers for item_id, floats for price).
Base64 Image Decoding
If the log contains Base64-encoded images, they are decoded using the Python base64 library and saved or displayed. This is crucial for logs that include images in their data.

### Data Visualization
The parsed data is visualized through the following types of charts:

**Bar charts** to show counts of different events (e.g., login, logout, errors).
**Line charts** to show trends over time (e.g., number of events per minute/hour).
**Pie charts** for categorical distributions (e.g., error types).
Web Server Log Parsing (if applicable)
For Apache/Nginx web server logs, the parser extracts:
Request counts
Response codes (e.g., 200, 404)
Access times (e.g., response time in milliseconds)

### Error Handling
The parser handles invalid log entries gracefully by:
Skipping log entries with missing or malformed data.
Printing informative error messages to help with debugging.
Ensuring the parser continues running even if a few entries are invalid.
